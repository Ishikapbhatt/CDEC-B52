# Introduction to Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) is a scalable, fully managed file storage service for AWS cloud environments. It allows multiple EC2 instances and services to access shared storage simultaneously.

Unlike EBS (Elastic Block Store), which is attached to a single instance, EFS provides shared, concurrent access to multiple instances, making it ideal for distributed applications, container storage, and data analytics.



# Introduction to NFS (Network File System)

NFS (Network File System) is a distributed file system protocol that allows multiple computers to access and share files over a network as if they were on a local disk. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984 and is commonly used in Linux and UNIX environments.

# Advantages of NFS

✔ Easy to Set Up – Simple to configure and integrate into existing systems

✔ Reduces Storage Costs – No need for duplicate files on multiple systems

✔ Supports Multiple Clients – Works with Linux, UNIX, and Windows clients

✔ Efficient Data Sharing – Fast access to remote files

# Disadvantages of NFS

❌ Security Risks – Needs proper configuration to prevent unauthorized access

❌ Performance Issues – Can slow down with large amounts of data transfer

❌ Dependent on Network – Requires a stable network connection
